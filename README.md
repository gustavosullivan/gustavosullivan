About Me

I’m a Computer Science student focused on software development and technology. My main area of interest is web development, working across both front-end and back-end, building responsive applications, APIs, and systems integrated with databases.

Alongside web development, I also study game development, where I enjoy combining programming, logic, and creativity using Unity and Unreal Engine.

I prefer learning through practice and real projects. When I face something I don’t know yet, I take time to study, test, and improve until I fully understand it.
